== PROJECT: BakingHome

---

== Overview

BakingHome is an one-stop application for staff in small to medium-sized family baking businesses who prefer to use a desktop app and command line to manage their business, such as recipes, inventory, orders as well as revenue. BakingHome is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) so that they can have a smoother experience with typing as compared to Graphic User Interface (GUI).
