## 4. BakingHome Overview
This section provides an overview of BakingHome.

### 4.1 Entities
BakingHome supports four types of entities: **Ingredient**, **Product**, **Order**, **Sale**. 

Here is an overview of the entities. 

- Ingredient is the most basic entity in BakingHome. It has a name and a unitless quantity. Some examples are `egg, 4` and `flour, 10`.
- Product is an item to sell in the bakery. It requires one or more ingredients to bake. Examples are `bread` and `cake`.
- Order is a collection of products requested by a customer. For example, `five bread and two cakes ordered by Mr. Yang`.
- Sale is a transaction. It can be either income or expenditure.

### 4.2 Feature Hightlights

BakingHome allows you to manage your products, orders, inventory, shopping list, and sales easily. Besides adding, deleting and editing the entities, BakingHome also supports:

- One step adding insufficient ingredients to the shopping list. 
- Automatically adding a sale entry upon completing an order or buying from the shopping list.
- Dynamically displaying inventory status (sufficient/insufficient ingredients) in an order.
- Productivity features: Undo, Redo, Autocomplete and Shortcut features that boost your productivity.

## 5. Command Format
This section specifies the formats you need to follow when entering a command.

### 5.1 General Format
- Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
- Items in curly brackets are optional e.g ``-name NAME {-status STATUS}`` can be used as `-name cake -status archive` or as `-name cake`.
- Items with `...` after them can be used zero or more times
- If items without `...` after them are used more than one time, only the last one will be taken. 
- Parameters can be in any order.
- `-` is a reserved symbol for BakingHome, so it cannot be used in parameter values. For example, a product cannot have the name `cheese-cake`.
- BakingHome does not allow exact duplicates of names. For example, if "egg" is already in the inventory list, "egg" cannot be added to the list but its plural form "eggs" can (as they have different naming). It is up to your discretion to name your objects.

### 5.2 Selecting Entries
In BakingHome, an `INDEX` is a positive integer representing an entry. You can select the entries you want to manage by specifying their indices. This can be done easily in three ways:
- Select a single `INDEX`: For example, `1`,`2`
- Select multiple `INDICES` with `,` : `INDEX1,INDEX2,INDEX3...`. For example, `1,2,3`, `2,5,8`
- Select a range of `INDICES` with `~`: `START~END`. `START` should not be greater than `END`. Examples: `1~8`, `9~10`

Note that some commands only allow you to select a single `INDEX`, while others allow you to select multiple `INDICES`

### 5.3 Date and Time
BakingHome uses your local time zone. A date should be entered in the format `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`. For example, `31/09/2019 18:00`.

Adds a product to the product list. 

|Attribute|Corresponding Parameter|Default Value|
|:---|:---|:---|

|`-price`|`PRICE`|0.0|

> üç≠ **HIGHLIGHT**
> Try out these **highly automated featuresÔºÅ**
> 1. Not sure about the cost upon adding a product? Don't worry, the system helps you generate one based on the ingredients given for your reference. i.e. in the above examples, if both 1 Flour costs $5, and 1 Sugar costs $1, then the system will assign an ingredient cost of $10 to Bread.
> 2. If the ingredients in the product are not in the current shopping list, the system will also automatically help you add a corresponding shopping list entry.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**
>1. Ingredients with the same name can be input multiple times but only the last one will be recorded. For example, for `[Butter, 3] [Butter, 2]` or `[Butter,3] [Sugar, 5] [Butter, 2]`, then quantity recorded will be 2.
>2. Once added, ingredient list in a product will not change even if the ingredients it contains are changed in Shopping List. This helps to retain the original product information. For example, changing the ingredient name of `Sugar` to `Brown sugar` will not affects the ingredients stored in `Cheese cake`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO**
Take note that a `product add` command does not take in -status parameter, i.e. a newly added product can only have *ACTIVE* status. To add an archived product, you can:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**
If you want to change the ingredient fields, you have to include all ingredients needed again. The system will **regenerate** the ingredients from the entry. i.e. `product edit -i 2 -name Large egg tart -ingt [Egg, 4]` indicates that Large egg tart only needs 4 portions of Egg.

Format: `order sort CRITERON {-re}`
- CRITERON should be one of the following: `status`, `deadline`, `total`, `creation` (case-insensitive).

### 7.2 AutoComplete
The AutoComplete feature saves you from the trouble of remembering all the command parameters by automatically predicting what they want to type.

#### Invoking AutoComplete:
Press `Tab` key to invoke AutoComplete. AutoComplete will automatically fill the prefixes or command word you want to enter where possible.

If there are multiple suggestions available, you can navigate among them by repeatedly pressing the `Tab` key.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**
> Some suggestions may not fit the context. For example, the input `order d` has two suggestions `order do` and `order done`. The former is not a valid command.

### 7.3 Shortcut

Shortcut provides a quick way to get tasks done without the hassle of entering commands one by one. It allows you to execute a series of commands by entering only one command.  You can create your own shortcuts in BakingHome.

#### 7.3.1 Setting a shortcut: `short`
Creates or deletes a shortcut.

Format: `short [SHORTCUT_NAME] [COMMAND_STRING]`
- `SHORTCUT_NAME` is the identifier of the shortcut. It should be a word.
    - A word cannot contain characters except for a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the underscore character.
- `COMMAND_STRING` can take three forms:
    - Blank
    - A single command. For example, `order add`
        - The command should be non-blank and cannot contain semicolon or square brackets
    - Multiple commands. For example, `order add; order done 1`
        - The commands should be separated by `;`. Each command cannot contain semicolons or square brackets.   
        - **Invalid** examples:
            - `order add; order done 1;`
            - `;order add`
            - `;order add;`
            - `order add -name [invalid brackets] -rmk a;b ; order remove`
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**
> - To prevent infinite loops, `COMMAND_STRING` cannot contain `do` commands.
> - `COMMAND_STRING` cannot contain square brackets.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO**
>- If `SHORTCUT_NAME` has already been set and `COMMAND_STRING` is valid, the new `COMMAND_STRING` will overwrite the old one.
>- If `SHORTCUT_NAME` has already been set and `COMMAND_STRING` is blank, the corresponding shortcut will be removed.
>- If `SHORTCUT_NAME` is not set and `COMMAND_STRING` is valid, the corresponding shortcut will be created.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO**
> Commands in command string are not verified at the time they are added. In other words, invalid commands (except for `do` commands) may be added into a shortcut using `short`. Commands are only verified when a shortcut is executed using `do` command.

Examples:
- `short [demo] [order add]` : adds a new shortcut `demo` with one command.
- `short [demo] [order add -name jj; order remove 1]` : overwrites `demo` with two commands.
- `short [demo] [ ]` : removes the `demo` shortcut.

#### 7.3.2 Executing a shortcut: `do`
Execute a shortcut. The commands in a shortcut will be executed in the order they were added.

Format: `do SHORTCUT_NAME`
Examples:
```
//First, create a shortcut with 2 commands
short [demo] [product add -name cake; order add -item cake, 1]

//Then, executes the shortcut.
//A new order and product will appear in BakingHome
do demo
```

#### 7.3.3 Viewing shortcuts:
You cannot view your shortcut list directly from the BakingHome app. However, you can check them in the data file.


### 7.4 Hot Keys
