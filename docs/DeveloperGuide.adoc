== Introduction

=== Purpose

This document describes the architecture, software design and implementation decisions of BakingHome, a one-stop application for managers of home bakeries to manage their business efficiently.

=== Audience

This documentation is intended for the developers, designers, and software testers of BakingHome.

=== Using the Guide

This guide follows the following format:

`mark-up` text represents a component or a command.

[NOTE]
This box provides additional information.

<<<
== Design

This section describes the architecture and components of BakingHome.
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::architecture_diagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of BakingHome.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

BakingHome consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `Manager` class.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::ui_class_diagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that contains 5 separate pages, namely the `SalePage`,
`ProductPage`, `ShoppingPage`, `InventoryPage` and `OrderPage`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
Some pages consist of smaller components.
For example, `SalePage` has a `SaleCard`, `ProductPage` has an
`IngredientCard`, and `OrderPage` has an `OrderCard` and an `OrderItemBox`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml`
files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::logic_diagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `LogicManager` uses the `BakingHomeParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (for example, deleting an order).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions, such as displaying a certain page to the user.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* Stores classes that are used for BakingHome (namely Ingredient, Customer, Order, IngredientInfoList, IngredientItemList, Product, ProductIngredient, Sale)

* Exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` of Orders, Products, Sales, Inventory, and ShoppingList that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

* Stores the UniqueEntityLists used for BakingHome and its methods.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::storage_diagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/tree/master/src/main/java/duke/storage/BakingHomeStorage.java[`BakingHomeStorage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* Can save the Ingredient objects, Ingredient Item objects, Order objects, Product objects, Product Item objects, Sale objects, and Shortcut objects, in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `duke.commons` package.

<<<

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Auto-Complete Feature

BakingHome comes with an auto-complete feature that predicts the commands or arguments that the user attempts to type based on what has already been entered.
Auto-Complete is invoked by pressing the `Tab` key.
If there are multiple suggestions available, the user can navigate among the suggestions by repeatedly pressing the `Tab` key.

==== Implementation

The auto-complete mechanism is facilitated by `AutoCompleter` in `Logic` component.

`AutoCompleter` has a nested class `Input`, which represents the details of user input, including the `text` and the `caretPosition`.

`AutoCompleter` implements the following operations:

* `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)` -- Adds a command class for `AutoCompleter` to complete.

* `AutoCompleter#isAutoCompletable(Input)` -- Returns true if the current user input can be completed by `AutoCompleter`.

* `AutoCompleter#complete()` -- Returns an `Input` object that specifies the details of the user input after auto-completion.

The last two operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#isAutoCompletable(Input)()` and `Model#complete()` respectively.


===== Workflow

When the user presses a key in the command box, command box checks if the key pressed is `Tab`.
If `Tab` is pressed, the command box checks with `AutoCompleter` to verify if the current input is auto-completable.
If the state is eligible for auto-completion, the command box will request for a suggestion by calling `Model#complete()` and set its text and caret position accordingly.
The workflow is illustrated in the diagram below:


.Workflow of AutoCompleter
image::auto_complete_activity_diagram.png[]


===== Navigating among suggestions

The auto-complete feature allows users to navigate among possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab`.

Internally, `AutoCompleter` maintains a list `suggestionList` containing all possible `Input` suggestions. `suggestionList` is implemented as a cyclic list by maintaining a `suggestionPointer`:

* When `AutoCompleter#complete()` is called, the `Input` object pointed by `suggestionPointer` in `suggestionList` is returned, and `suggestionPointer` is set to `(suggestionPointer + 1) % suggestionList.size()`.

* `suggestionList` is updated if the user input no longer matches any of the suggestions in `suggestionList`.

===== Extending Auto-Complete to More Commands

Following the Open-Closed Principle, the Auto-Complete feature is highly extensible.

You can add a command to support auto-completion by taking the following steps:

*Step 1.* Declare `AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR` and `AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` fields in your command class.

[NOTE]
`AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR` is a string specifying when the arguments should be completed.
Auto-complete only completes the arguments of a command when the text in command box with that command's `AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR`.
`AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` is an array of `Prefix` that you want to auto-complete.

An example is shown below:
```java
public class AddOrderCommand extends Command {
    public static final String AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR = "order add"; // This tells AutoCompleter that  if  user input begins with "order add", it should be recognized as an AddOrderCommand by AutoCompleter.
    public static final Prefix[] AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS = new Prefix("by"), new Prefix("name"); //This tells AutoCompleter that  AddOrderCommand has these parameters.
}
```

*Step 2.* Add the command to `AutoCompleter` by calling `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)`

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect 1: Extending AutoComplete to more commands

* Alternative 1: Hard-code command words and arguments in AutoCompleter class.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Violates the Open-Closed Principle because developers need to modify AutoCompleter's internal structure to add new commands.
Also, it makes code more coupled since if we change parameters of a command, we need to change corresponding fields in AutoCompleter as well.

* Alternative 2 (Current choice): Use Reflection API to obtain command words and arguments from CommandClass at runtime.

** Pros: Avoids modification to the internal structure of AutoCompleter class

** Cons: Since Reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, it could lead to unexpected side-effects if implemented wrongly.

===== Aspect 2: Displaying multiple suggestions

* Alternative 1: Use a drop-down list to display all possible suggestions.
** Pros: Intuitive and allows users to see all possible commands in one place.
** Cons: Hard to implement.
May require additional components other than JavaFx's built-in components.

* Alternative 2 (Current choice): Navigate between possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab` key.
** Pros: Easier to implement since no additional components are needed
** Cons: Cannot display all possible commands in one place.

=== Filter Product Feature

==== Implementation

BakingHome's products can have two status: `ACTIVE` or `ARCHIVE`.
This feature allows user to view products with a given certain status, i.e. shows only products with an ARCHIVE status.

The filter mechanism in product is facilitated by
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/transformation/FilteredList.html[FilteredList]
which wraps a ObservableList and
filters using the provided Predicate.
A `FilteredList<Product> filteredProducts` is stored in the `ModelManager`.
In `BakingHome`, there is an
`ObservableList<Product> products` which contains all products, regardless of its status. `filteredProducts`
in the ModelManager is initialized with this ObservableList.

Since a FilteredList needs a Predicate, which matches the elements in the source list that should be visible, the filter mechanism implements the following operation to support filtering:

* `Model#updateFilteredProductList(Predicate<Product> predicate)` -- Sets the value of the property Predicate in the `filteredProducts`.

** Predicates are declared statically in the `Model` interface, namely
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PRODUCTS`, `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVE_PRODUCTS`, and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PRODUCT`.
In particular `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVE_PRODUCTS` is as follows
```java
    Predicate<Product> PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVE_PRODUCTS = product -> {
        return product.getStatus() == Product.Status.ARCHIVE;
    };
```

** The `ListProductCommand` will call this method to change the visibility of products with different status by passing in the corresponding predicate.

An example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step is shown below.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time.
`UniqueProductList` will be initialized with a list of default products in BakingHome.
This list contains a few active products and a few archived products.

**Step 2.** The user inputs `product filter -scope archive` to list all archived products. `UI` passes the input to `Logic`.
Logic then uses a few `Parser` classes to extract layers of information out as seen from steps 3 to 5.

**Step 3.** Logic passes the user input to `BakingHomeParser`. `BakingHomeParser` identifies that this is a `ProductCommand`
through the word "product".
It then creates a
`ProductCommandParser` to parse the remaining information, i.e. "filter -scope archive".

**Step 4.** `ProductCommandParser` identifies that this is a `FilterProductCommand` through the word "filter".
It then creates a `FilterProductCommandParser` to parse the scope.

**Step 5.** `FilterProductCommandParser` parse "-scope archive" and get the scope.
It then returns a
`FilterProductCommand` with the scope information.

**Step 6.** `Logic` finally gets the `FilterProductCommand` and execute it.
The execution firstly calls
`Model#updateFilteredProductList(Predicate<Product> predicate)` to update the Predicate in
`filteredProducts` in `Model`.
This execution then returns a `CommandResult` to `UI`, containing the response to the user.

**Step 7.** `UI` displays the response in the `CommandResult`.
In addition, UI will change to display archived products after model updates `filteredProducts`, since `UI` is constantly listening for the change in `Model`.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the above mentioned scenario.

.Sequence Diagram for Filter Product Mechanism
image::FilterProductSD.png[]

Note that almost all other commands follow the same sequence, with different `Command` and `Parser` classes.

==== Design considerations

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Save all products in an `ObservableList` in `BakingHome`, and keep a
`FilteredList` in the `ModelManager`. `ProductCommandParser` parses the user input and gets the Predicate to update the `FilteredList`.
** Advantages: Implementation is clearer and code is more human-readable.
** Disadvantages: More difficult to write a Predicate.

* Alternative 2: Keep two separate product lists, one for archived products and one for active products.
** Advantages: Fast access to products of both status.
** Disadvantages: Implementation will become complicated.
It also makes it very expensive when adding features like sorting all products according to name, price or cost.

* Alternative 2: Keep only one list of products.
Loop through the list to get the products with the desired status.
** Advantages: Simplicity in storing data.
** Disadvantages: Time complexity is very high, resulting in a slow response of the application when the product list gets long.

=== Buy Shopping List Feature

BakingHome comes with a `shop buy` command in its shopping list feature.
This command transfers ingredients and its respective quantity from the shopping list to the inventory list.
It will then generate a sales transaction automatically in the Sales page.

==== Implementation

The `shop buy` feature is facilitated by the `UniqueEntityLists` initialized in BakingHome, which is an implementation of `Iterable` and contains an `ObservableList`.
There are 3 `UniqueEntityLists`, `inventory`, `shoppingList` and `sales`, which are involved in this feature and each of them has an `add` and `set` operation.

* `UniqueEntityList<class>#add(toAdd)` - Adds object `toAdd` into the `ObservableList` stored in the `UniqueEntityList`.

* `UniqueEntityList<class>#set(toEdit, edited)` - Replaces object `toEdit` with the new object `edited` in the `ObservableList` stored in the `UniqueEntityList`.
Object
`edited` will take the index position of object `toEdit` in the `ObservableList`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addInventory`, `Model#setInventory`, `Model#setShoppingList`, and `Model#addSaleFromShopping`.
The `UniqueEntityLists` are also exposed in the `Model` as `FilteredLists`, which wraps an `ObservableList` and filters using the provided `Predicate`.

==== Workflow

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `shop buy` mechanism works.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time.
The `UniqueEntityLists` `inventory`, `shoppingList`, and `sales` are initialized in BakingHome with the initial data stored in the `Storage`.

*Step 2.* The user inputs `shop buy 1,2` command to buy the first and second ingredient in the shopping list.
This command goes through the `Parser` to get the indices of the ingredients to be bought and executes the `BuyShoppingCommand`.

*Step 3.* The `BuyShoppingCommand` calls the `FilteredLists` stored in the `Model`
through `Model#getFilteredInventoryList()`, `Model#getFilteredShoppingList()` and stores them in the `ArrayLists<Item<Ingredient>>` `inventoryList` and `shoppingList` respectively.

*Step 4.* For every index, the `Item<Ingredient>` object is called from `shoppingList`.
Each ingredient is checked whether `inventoryList` already contains it using
`inventoryList#contain(Item<Ingredient> toBuy)`.

* If `inventoryList` contains it, a new `Item<Ingredient>` constructor is created with the added quantities of both lists.
The new constructor then replaces the current one in `inventoryList` using the `inventoryList#set()` method.

* Else, the `Item<Ingredient>` object in `shoppingList` is just added to `inventoryList` using the `inventoryList#add()` method.

*Step 6.* For every ingredient that is bought in the shopping list, a new `Item<Ingredient>` constructor is created using the original ingredient’s data but with quantity = 0. This new constructor then replaces the current one in `shoppingList` using the `shoppingList#set()` method.

*Step 7.* `BuyShoppingCommand` will calculate the total cost of the ingredients bought and pass it as parameters to `AddSaleFromShopping` method in `Model`, along with an `ArrayList` of the bought ingredients. `AddSaleFromShopping` will then create a `Sale` constructor with these values and add it to `sales`.

*Step 8.* These will be updated in the `UI` automatically as these objects are stored in `ObservableLists`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `shop buy` mechanism works in showing the correct UI to the user after a `shop buy` command is inputted.

.Sequence Diagram for Shop Buy Mechanism
image::shopBuySD.png[]

==== Design considerations

* Alternative 1: Removing the ingredients from the shopping list after they are bought.

** Pros: The shopping list is clearer and more readable for the user as redundant ingredients that he/she has already bought will not be shown on the list.

** Cons: The costs and remarks that the user had made will be lost and he has to input them again the next time he wants to buy the same ingredients.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Set the bought ingredients’ quantity to 0 in the shopping list.

** Pros: There is a saved template of the shopping list with past costs and remarks of the ingredients, making it convenient for the user to just edit the quantity to the quantity he needs to buy.

** Cons: The shopping list may become very cluttered with too many ingredients.
Hence, a `shop list` command can be executed in the command line to filter out ingredients that have 0 quantity.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging. e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Bakery managers of home bakeries, who prefer typing and is willing to use a Desktop application to manage his business.

Such a manager needs to take care of every single aspect of his bakery business, from allocating responsibilities and keeping track of revenue, to taking the customer's order.
He might even need to do the baking, since there is limited manpower.

Though currently there are many well-developed applications for the work he needs to do, there isn't one that integrates all the features he needs.
Thus, it is hard for him to switch between different apps to manage his bakery business.

BakingHome is a one-stop desktop application that has all the important features for such a manager to eliminate the trouble of changing between different apps.

*Value proposition*:

A one-stop bakery management system for home bakeries.
