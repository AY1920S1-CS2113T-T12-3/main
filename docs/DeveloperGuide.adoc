== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::architecture_diagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of BakingHome.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

BakingHome consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `Manager` class.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::logic_diagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `LogicManager` uses the `BakingHomeParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (for example, deleting an order).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying a certain page to the user.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::model.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::storage_diagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save the Ingredient objects, Ingredient Item objects, Order objects, Product objects, Product Item objects, Sale objects, and Shortcut objects, in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Auto-Complete Feature

BakingHome comes with a auto-complete feature that predicts the commands or arguments that the user attempts to type based on what has already been entered.
Auto-Complete is invoked by pressing the `Tab` key.
If there are multiple suggestions available, the user can navigate among the suggestions by repeatedly pressing the `Tab` key.

==== Implementation

Auto-complete mechanism is facilitated by `AutoCompleter` in `Logic` component.  

`AutoCompleter` implements the following operations:

* `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)` -- Adds a command class for `AutoCompleter` to complete.

* `AutoCompleter#isAutoCompletable(Input)` -- Returns true if the current user input can be completed by `AutoCompleter`.

* `AutoCompleter#complete()` -- Returns a  `UserInputState` that specifies the details of the user input after auto-completion.

The last two operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#isAutoCompletable(UserInputState)()` and `Model#complete()` respectively.

In addition, `AutoCompleter` has a nested class `Input`, which represents the details of a user input, including the `text` and the `caretPosition`.

===== Workflow

When the user presses a key in the command box, command box checks if the key pressed is `Tab`.
If `Tab` is pressed, the text field checks with `AutoCompleter` to verify if the current input is auto-completable.
If the state is eligible for auto-completion, command box will request for a suggestion by calling `Model#complete()` and set its text and caret position accordingly.
The workflow is illustrated in the diagram below:


.Workflow of AutoCompleter
image::auto_complete_activity_diagram.png[]


===== Navigating among suggestions

The auto-complete feature allows the user to navigate among possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab`.

Internally, `AutoCompleter` maintains a list `suggestionList` containing all possible `Input` suggestions. `suggestionList` is implemented as a cyclic list by maintaining a `suggestionPointer`:

* When `AutoCompleter#complete()` is called, the `Input` object pointed by `suggestionPointer` in `suggestionList` is returned, and `suggestionPointer` is set to `(suggestionPointer + 1) % suggestionList.size()`.

* `suggestionList` is updated if the user input no longer matches any of the suggestions in `suggestionList`.

===== Extending Auto-Complete to More Commands

Following the Open-Closed Principle, the Auto-Complete feature is highly extensible.
You can add a command to support auto-completion by taking the following steps:

*Step 1.* Declare `AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR` and `AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` fields in your command class.

[NOTE]
`AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR` is a string specifying when the arguments should be completed.
Auto-complete only completes the arguments of a command when the text in command box with that command's `AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR`.
`AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` is an array of `Prefix` that you want to auto-complete.

An example is shown below:
```java
public class AddOrderCommand extends Command {
    public static final String AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR = "order add"; // This tells AutoCompleter that  if  user input begins with "order add", it should be recognized as an AddOrderCommand by AutoCompleter.
    public static final Prefix[] AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS = new Prefix("by"), new Prefix("name"); //This tells AutoCompleter that  AddOrderCommand has these parameters.
}
```

*Step 2.* Add the command to `AutoCompleter` by calling `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)`

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect 1: Extending AutoComplete to more commands

 * Alternative 1: Hard-code command words and arguments in AutoCompleter class.
 
 ** Pros: Easy to implement.
 
 ** Cons: Violates the Open-Closed Principle because developers need to modify AutoCompleter's internal structure to add new commands.
 Also, it makes code more coupled since if we change parameters of a command, we need to change corresponding fields in AutoCompleter as well.

 * Alternative 2 (Current choice): Use Reflection API to obtain command words and arguments from CommandClass at runtime.
 
 ** Pros: Avoids modification to the internal structure of AutoCompleter class
 
 ** Cons: Since Reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code,

It could lead to unexpected side-effects if implemented wrongly.

===== Aspect 2: Displaying multiple suggestions

* Alternative 1: Use a drop-down list to display all possible suggestions.
** Pros: Intuitive and allows users to see all possible commands in one place.
* Cons: Hard to implement.
May require additional components other than JavaFx's built-in components.
May require additional components other than JavaFx's built-in components.
* Alternative 2 (Current choice): Navigate between possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab` key.
** Pros: Easier to implement since no additional components are needed
** Cons: Cannot display all possible commands in one place.

=== Filter Product Feature

==== Implementation

==== Design considerations

=== Buy Shopping List Feature

BakingHome comes with a `shop buy` command in its shopping list feature.
This command transfers ingredients and its respective quantity from the shopping list to the inventory list.
It will then also generate a sales transaction automatically in the Sales page.

==== Implementation

The `shop buy` feature is facilitated by the `UniqueEntityLists` initialized in BakingHome, which is an implementation of `Iterable` and contains an `ObservableList`.
There are 3 `UniqueEntityLists`, `inventory`, `shoppingList` and `sales`, which are involved in this feature and each of them has an `add` and `set` operation.

* `UniqueEntityList<class>#add(toAdd)` - Adds object `toAdd` into the `ObservableList` stored in the `UniqueEntityList`.

* `UniqueEntityList<class>#set(toEdit, edited)` - Replaces object `toEdit` with the new object `edited` in the `ObservableList` stored in the `UniqueEntityList`.
Object
`edited` will take the index position of object `toEdit` in the `ObservableList`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addInventory`, `Model#setInventory`, `Model#setShoppingList`, and `Model#addSaleFromShopping`.
The `UniqueEntityLists` are also exposed in the `Model` as `FilteredLists`, which wraps an `ObservableList` and filters using the provided `Predicate`.

==== Workflow

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `shop buy` mechanism works.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time.
The `UniqueEntityLists` `inventory`, `shoppingList`, and `sales` are initialized in BakingHome with the initial data stored in the `Storage`.

*Step 2.* The user inputs `shop buy 1,2` command to buy the first and second ingredient in the shopping list.
This command goes through the `Parser` to get the indices of the ingredients that is to be bought and executes the `BuyShoppingCommand`.

*Step 3.* The `BuyShoppingCommand` calls the `FilteredLists` stored in the `Model`
through `Model#getFilteredInventoryList()`, `Model#getFilteredShoppingList()` and stores them in `ArrayLists<Item<Ingredient>>` `inventoryList` and `shoppingList` respectively.

*Step 4.* For every index, the `Item<Ingredient>` object is called from `shoppingList`.
Each ingredient is checked whether `inventoryList` already contains it using
`inventoryList#contain(Item<Ingredient> toBuy)`.

* If `inventoryList` contains it, a new `Item<Ingredient>` constructor is created with the added quantities of both lists.
The new constructor then replaces the current one in `inventoryList` using the `inventoryList#set()` method.

* Else, the `Item<Ingredient>` object in `shoppingList` is just added to `inventoryList` using the `inventoryList#add()` method.

*Step 6.* For every ingredient that is bought in the shopping list, a new `Item<Ingredient>` constructor is created using the original ingredient’s data but with quantity = 0. This new constructor then replaces the current one in `shoppingList` using the `shoppingList#set()` method.

*Step 7.* `BuyShoppingCommand` will calculate the total cost of the ingredients bought and pass it as parameters to `AddSaleFromShopping` method in `Model`, along with an `ArrayList` of the bought ingredients. `AddSaleFromShopping` will then create a `Sale` constructor with these values and add it to `sales`.

*Step 8.* These will be updated in the `UI` automatically as these objects are stored in `ObservableLists`.

==== Design considerations

* Alternative 1: Removing the ingredients from the shopping list after they are bought.

** Pros: The shopping list is clearer and more readable for the user as redundant ingredients that he/she has already bought will not be shown on the list.

** Cons: The costs and remarks that the user had made will be lost and he has to input them again the next time he wants to buy the same ingredients.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Set the bought ingredients’ quantity to 0 in the shopping list.

** Pros: There is a saved template of the shopping list with past costs and remarks of the ingredients, making it convenient for the user to just edit the quantity to the quantity he needs to buy.

** Cons: The shopping list may become very cluttered with too many ingredients.
Hence, a `shop list` command can be executed in the command line to filter out ingredients that have 0 quantity.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Bakery managers of home bakeries, who prefer typing and is willing to use a Desktop application to manage his business.

Such a manager needs to take care of every single aspect of his bakery business, from allocating, from keeping track of revenue, to taking the customers order.
He might even need to do the baking, since there are limited man power.

Though currently there are many well developed applications for the stuff he needs to do, there is not an application that integrates all the features he needs.
It is hard for him to switch between different apps.

BakingHome is an one-stop desktop application that has all the important features for such a manager to eliminate the trouble of changing between different apps.

*Value proposition*: All-in-one bakery management system for home bakeries.
