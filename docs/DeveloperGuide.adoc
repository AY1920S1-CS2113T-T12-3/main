== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::architecture_diagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of BakingHome.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

BakingHome consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `Manager` class.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::ui_class_diagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that contains 5 separate pages, namely.`SalePage`,
`ProductPage`, `Shopping`, `InventoryPage` and `OrderPage`. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit
from the abstract `UiPart` class.
Some page consists of smaller components, for example, `SalePage` has a `SaleCard`, `ProductPage` has a
`IngredientCard` and `OrderPage` has a `OrderCard` and a `OrderItemBox`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml`
files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{https://github
.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main.git}/src/main/java/duke/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is
specified in
link:{https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main.git}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::logic_diagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `LogicManager` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (for example, deleting an order).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying a certain page to the user.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Auto-Complete Feature

BakingHome comes with a auto-complete feature that predicts the commands or arguments that the user attempts to type based on what has already been entered.
Auto-Complete is invoked by pressing the `Tab` key.
If there are multiple suggestions available, the user can navigate among the suggestions by repeatedly pressing the `Tab` key.

==== Implementation

Auto-complete mechanism is facilitated by `AutoCompleter` in `Logic` component.  

`AutoCompleter` implements the following operations:

* `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)` -- Adds a command class for `AutoCompleter` to complete.

* `AutoCompleter#isAutoCompletable(UserInputState)` -- Returns true if the current user input can be completed by `AutoCompleter`.

* `AutoCompleter#complete()` -- Returns a  `UserInputState` that specifies the details of the user input after auto-completion.

The last two operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#isAutoCompletable(UserInputState)()` and `Model#complete()` respectively.

In addition, `AutoCompleter` has a nested class `UserInputState`, which reprsents the details of a user input status, including the text and the position of the caret.

===== Workflow

When the user presses a key in `UserInputTextField`, `UserInputTextField` checks if the key pressed is `Tab`. If `Tab` is pressed, the text field checks with `AutoCompleter` to verify if the current state is auto-completable. If the state is auto-completable, `UserInputTextField` will request for a suggestion by calling `Model#complete()` and set itself (including the text and caret position) accordingly. The workflow is illustrated in the diagram below:

image::auto_complete_activity_diagram.png[]

//TODO: Add figure X

===== Navigating among suggestions

The auto-complete feature allows the user to navigate among possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab`.

Internally, `AutoCompleter` maintains a cyclic list `SuggestionList` containing possible suggestions and a  `suggestionPointer` pointing to the current suggestion:

 * `suggestionPointer` moves to the next position and the suggestion when `AutoCompleter#complete()` is called.

 * `SuggestionList` is updated if the user input no longer matches any of the suggestions in `SuggestionList`.

===== Extending Auto-Complete to More Commands

Following Open-Closed Principle, the Auto-Complete feature is designed to be extensible. You can add a command to support auto-completion by taking the following steps:

*Step 1.* Declare `COMMAND_WORD`, `AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR`(optional) and `AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` (optional) in your command class.

[NOTE] 
`AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR` is a string specifying when should the arguments be completed. Auto-complete only completes the arguments when this field is present in the beginning of user input;
`AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS` is an array of `Prefix` that that you want to auto-complete.

An example is shown below:

```java
public static final String AUTO_COMPLETE_INDICATOR = "order add";
public static final Prefix[] AUTO_COMPLETE_PARAMETERS = { new Prefix("by"), new Prefix("name")};
```

*Step 2.* Add the command to `AutoCompleter` by calling `AutoCompleter#addCommandClass(Class<? extends Command>)`

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect 1: Extending AutoComplete to more commands
 * Alternative 1: Hard-code command words and arguments in AutoCompleter class.
 ** Advantages: Easy to implement.
 ** Disadvantages: Violates the Open-Closed Principle. Makes AutoCompleter more error-prone.

 * Alternative 2 (Current choice): Use Reflection API to obtain command words and arguments from CommandClass at runtime.
 ** Advantages: Avoids modification to the internal structure of AutoCompleter class
 ** Disadvantages: Since Reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code,
it could lead to unexpected side-effects if implemented wrongly.

===== Aspect 2: Displaying multiple suggestions

* Alternative 1: Use a drop-down list to display all possible suggestions.
** Advantages: Intuitive and allows users to see all possible commands in one place.
* Disadvantages: Hard to implement.
May require additional components other than JavaFx's built-in components.
* Alternative 2 (Current choice): Navigate between possible suggestions by repeatedly pressing `Tab` key.
** Advantages: Easier to implement since no additional components are needed
** Disadvantages: Cannot display all possible commands in one place.

=== Filter Product Feature

==== Implementation
This feature shows only products with a certain status, i.e. shows only products with an ARCHIVE status.

The filter mechanism in product is facilitated by `FilteredList` which wraps a `ObservableList` and filters
using the provided Predicate.
A `FilteredList<Product>`  `filteredProducts` is stored in the `ModelManager`. In `BakingHome`, there is an
`ObservableList<Product>` `products` which contains all products, regardless of the status. `filteredProducts`
in the ModelManager is initialized with this ObservableList.

Since a FilteredList needs a Predicate, which matches the elements in the source list that should be visible,
the filter mechanism implements the following operation to support filtering:
* `Model#updateFilteredProductList(Predicate<Product> predicate)` -- Sets the value of the
property Predicate in the `filteredProducts`. The `ListProductCommand` will use this method to change the
visibility of products with different status by passing in the corresponding predicate.
The predicates declared statically in the `Model` interface, namely `PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PRODUCTS`,
* `PREDICATE_SHOW_ARCHIVE_PRODUCTS`, and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PRODUCT`.

An example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step is shown below.
**Step1.** The user launched the application for the first time.
UniqueProductList will be initialized with a list of default products in BakingHome. This list
contains a few active products and a few archived products.

**Step 2.** The user executes `product filter -scope archive` command to list all archived products.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for filter product feature.

.Sequence Diagram for Filter Product Mechanism
image::FilterProductSD.png[]

==== Design considerations
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Save all products in a `ObservableList` in `BakingHome`, and keeps a
`FilteredList` in the `ModleManager`. `ProductCommandParser` parses the user input and gets the Predicate to
update the `FilteredList`.
 ** Advantages: Implementation is clearer and code is more human-readable.
** Disadvantages: More difficult to write a Predicate.

* Alternative 2: Keep two separate product lists, one for archived products one for active products.
** Advantages: Fast access to products both status.
** Disadvantages: Implementation will become complicated. It also makes it very expensive when adding
features like sorting all products according to name, price or cost.

* Alternative 2: Keep only one List of products. Loop through the list to get the products with the desired
status.
** Advantages: Simplicity in storing data.
** Disadvantages: Time complexity is very high, resulting in a slow response of the application when the
product list gets
long.

=== Buy Shopping List feature

==== Implementation

==== Design considerations

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Bakery managers of home bakeries, who prefer typing and is willing to use a Desktop application to manage his business.

Such a manager needs to take care of every single aspect of his bakery business, from allocating, from keeping track of revenue, to taking the customers order.
He might even need to do the baking, since there are limited man power.

Though currently there are many well developed applications for the stuff he needs to do, there is not an application that integrates all the features he needs.
It is hard for him to switch between different apps.

BakingHome is an one-stop desktop application that has all the important features for such a manager to eliminate the trouble of changing between different apps.

*Value proposition*: All-in-one bakery management system for home bakeries.
